# Dotfiles 👋

This is my current dotfile setup. It is opinionated and I can't guarantee
that it will work for anyone who isn't me. But use these to experiment,
learn, and heck - maybe you just want the exact same setup I use. In that
case, go all out and run `bin/dotfiles`.

### What's included

* Vim setup
* Git configuration
* Tmux configuration
* Ack configuration
* Fish shell setup

### Installation process

Here's the quick and dirty setup process:

```
git clone git@github.com:fredoliveira/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
bin/dotfiles
```
