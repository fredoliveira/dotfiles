# Dotfiles ðŸ‘‹

This is my current dotfile setup. It is opinionated and I can't guarantee
that it will work for anyone who isn't me. But use these to experiment,
learn, and heck - maybe you just want the exact same setup I use. In that
case, go all out and run `./install`

### What's included

- Vim setup (see `install-vim` and `configs/vimrc`)
- Git configuration (With `git-flow`)
- Tmux configuration (With TPM)
- Zsh shell setup (with `antigen`)
- A couple of terminal fonts

### Installation process

The process has been significantly simplified. All you should have to do is
clone the repository and `./install`. If you are on a mac, you may want to 
install mac dependencies with `./install-mac`, too. 

```
git clone git@github.com:fredoliveira/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install
```
