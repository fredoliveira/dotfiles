# Dotfiles 👋

This is my current dotfile setup. It is opinionated and I can't guarantee
that it will work for anyone who isn't me. But use these to experiment,
learn, and heck - maybe you just want the exact same setup I use. In that
case, go all out and look below for instructions.

### What's included

- Vim setup (see `install-vim` and `configs/vimrc`)
- Git configuration (With `git-flow`)
- Tmux configuration (With TPM)
- Zsh shell setup (with `starship` and `antidote`)
- A couple of terminal fonts

### Installation process

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io/lb)" -- init --apply fredoliveira
```
